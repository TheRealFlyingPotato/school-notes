* Vrms
* before connecting: i = V/R
  * after: i = V/R+r (r basically 0)
  * config the multimeter (change the mode to low, connect in series)

#2 : Added frequency offset. The graph moved up on the MSO.
#3 : .01-.02 frequency @ 1 kHz, .010-.011 frequency @ 10 kHz, .051-.052 frequency @ 50 kHz
#4 : I generated 7v on the power supply and measured it using the DMM. It seems to have a bit of power loss from point A to B (e.g. it the DMM reads slightly loewr than what is being produced)
#5 : Seems like anything possibly generated by the TENMA looks pretty square.
