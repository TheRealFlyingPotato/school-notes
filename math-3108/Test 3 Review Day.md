# In-Class
### Format
<br>same as usual
### Topics
* Section 4.5, 4.6, 5.1-5.3, 5.5, 6.1-6.4
* 4.1 - 4.4 is relevant to 4.5 and 4.6
* QR factorization:
  * Q is an orthonormal basis for the column space
  * R is an nxn upper triangular invertible matrix with positive entries on its diagonal
  * process  
    * 1. use gran-schmidt to find an orthonormal basis
    * 2. since A = QR
      * Q<sup>T</sup>A = Q<sup>T</sup>QR
      * Q<sup>T</sup>A = R
*  Complex Eigenvalue example
* row space : row vectors ({[1,2,3],[4,5,6]}
* Row A = Col A<sup>T</sup>
* the "usual inner product" is the dot product. We have not to this point worked with any of them.
# My Notes
## 4.3
* a set of vectors forms a basis for R<sup>n</sup> if they are linearly independent and span R<sup>n</sup>
* basis for null space: row reduce, use free variables
* basis for column space: row reduce, use pivot columns of original matrix
## 4.4
