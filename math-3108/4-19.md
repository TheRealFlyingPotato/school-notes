* a set of vectors {u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>, ... , u<sub>p</sub>} is orthogonal if every pair in the set is orthogonal
* if a set S is made of orthogonal nonzero vectors, the S is a basis of the subspace spanned by S.
* An orthogonal basis for a subspace W of R<sup>n</sup> is a basis for W that is also an orthogonal set.
* if I have an orthogonal basis for a subspace W of R<sup>n</sup>, then each y in W can be wrtitten as c<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1</sub> + ... + c<sub>p</sub>u<sub>p</sub>
  * where the weights are given by c<sub>j</sub> = <sub>y</sub> . u<sub>j</sub> / u<sub>j</sub> . u<sub>j</sub>
* [4.19.1: Example 1: 2 parts]
### Orthogonal Projections
* goal: take a vector in R<sup>n</sup> and write it as a sum of 2 vectors: one is a multiple of some nonzero vector u in R<sup>n</sup> and the other is orthogonal to u.
  * y = yhat + z where yhat = cu for some scalar c and z is orthogonal to u.
* [4.19.2: Explanation]
* if y = <b>y</b><sup>hat</sup> + z where yhat = alpha<b>u</b>, then
  * y<sup>hat</sup> is the orthogonal projection of y onto u
  * z is the component of y orthogonal to u
* if L is the subspace spanned by u, y<sup>hat</sup> is also called the orthogonal projection of y onto L.
  * specifically, <b>y</b><sup>hat</sup> = proj<sub>L</sub>y = (__y__ . __u__ / __u__ . __u__)*__u__
