### Real Vectors
* The set of all vectors with two entreis where both entreis are real is called R<sup>2</sup>
* The set of all vectors with three entries where all three are real is called R<sup>3</sup>
* The set of all vectors with n entries where all n are real is called R<sup>n</sup>
### Visualizing Vectors

### Algebraic Properties of R<sup>n</sup>
For all vectors __u__, __v__, and __w__ in R<sup>n</sup> and all scalars (constantS) c and d, the following 8 properties hold:
1. Vector addition is commutative
  * __u__ + __v__ = __v__ + __u__
  * when you commute from home to work / work to home
2. Vector addition is associative 
  * (__u__ + __v__) + __w__ = __u__ + (__v__ + __w__)
  * today I associate with you, tommorrow I associate with someone else
3. u + zero fector = __0__ + __u__ = __u__
4. __u__ + -__u__ = (-__u__) + __u__ = __0__
5. c(__u__ + __v__) = c__u__ + c__v__
6. (c + d)(__u__) = c__u__ + d__u__
7. (c)(d__u__) = (cd)__u__
8. 1__u__ = __u__

### Terminology
if I have p vectors in R^n
__y__ = c<sub>1</sub>__v__<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>__v__<sub>2</sub> + ... + c<sub>n</sub>__v__<sub>n</sub>
__y__ is a linear combination of the vectors v<sub>n</sub> with weights c<sub>n</sub>
through some combination of 2 vectors I can express any point on the 2d plane

### Vector Equation
x<sub>n</sub>__a__<sub>n</sub> + ... = __b__
has the same solution set as the linear system whose augmented matrix is
[__a__<sub>n</sub> ... __b__]

### span
* if I have a set of p vectors in R<sup>n</sup> then the set of all linear combs of vectors is the span
* line example: the span of 1 non-zero vector in R<sup>2</sup> is the line. 
* A span of a set of non-zero vectors will always include the origin
* the span of 2 non-zero vectors in R<sup>2</sup> is the plane
* EX 2 revisited:
  * span of u: the line
  * Span{u, v}: all of R<sup>2</sup>
* Ex 3 (revisited)
  * able to express __b__ as a linear combination
  * equivalently: __b__ is in the span of __a__<sub>1</sub>, __a__<sub>2</sub>, and __a__<sub>3</sub>
* if I have a non-zero vector in R<sup>n</sup>, then the span is the of all points on the line in R<sup>n</sup> passing through __v__ and the origin.
* if I have 2 non-zero vectors in R<sup>2</sup> then the span is either
  * a line through the origin and __u__ if __v__ is a constant multiple of __u__
  * all of R<sup>2</sup>
* if u and v are two nonzero vectors in R<sup>3</sup>
  * a line through the origin and __u__ if __v__ is a constant multiple of __u__
  * the plane containing the origin, __u__, and __v__ if __v__ is not a constant multiple of __u__
  
# example 4: 01.28.b
* For what values of h will y be in Span{__V__1, __v__2, __v__3}?
