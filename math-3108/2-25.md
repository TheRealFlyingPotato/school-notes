### LU factorizatoin

* Examples (2.25.1, 2.25.2)
### 3.1? Determinants of bigger stuff
* Example 1 (2.25.3)
* Determinant of an nxn matrix A can be computed by a cofactor expansion across any row or down any column
  * do what's easiest: use the row/column with the most zeros
  * follow the sign pattern
* Example 2 (2.25.4)
* if A is a triangular matrix, then detA is the product of the entries on the main diagonal of A.
  * Example 3 (2.25.5)
    * swapping the rows, negates that
* Example 4 (didn't do)
