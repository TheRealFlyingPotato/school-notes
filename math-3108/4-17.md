# 6.1 : Inner product, length, orthonagality
## [Notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aWbMuEYz7dkshjQkReQRBUnnJwGZ-MnU)
### The (usual) inner product
  * [4.17.1: Example 1]
  * u . v = <b>u</b>sup>T</sup><b>v</b>
  * order of dot product doesn't matter
  * (u + v) * w = u . w + v . w
  * (cu) . v = c(u . v) = u . (cv)
  * u . u >= 0, and u . u = 0 if and only if u . u = 0
  * [Norm of a vector]
  * a vector with norm (length) 1 is a unit vector
  * dividing a vector by its norm gives the unit vector
  * [4.17.2: Example 2]
### Distances in R<sup>n</sup>
  * dist(<b>u</b>,v) = ||<b>u</b> - <b>v</b>||
### orthogonality
  * 2 vectors are orthogonal (perpendicualr in R2 or R3) if and only if __u__ . __v__ = 0
    * equivalently, ||__u__ + __v__||<sup>2</sup> = ||__u__||<sup>2</sup> + ||__v__||<sup>2</sup>
    * proving it:
      * dist(__u__, __v__) = dist(__u__,-__v__)
      * ||__u__=__v__|| = ||__u__-(-__v__)||
      * for computational convenience, we really want ||u-v||^2 = ||u+v||^2
      * ||u+v||^2 = (u+v) . (u+v) = u . (u + v) + v . (u + v)
      * (u + v) . u + (u + v) . v
      * u . u + v . u + u . v + v . v
      * ||u||^2 + ||v||^2 + 2(u . v)
      * similarly, ||u - v||^2 = ||u||^2 + ||v||^2 - 2(u . v)
      * for these quantities to be equal, 2(u . v) = -2(u . v)
      * so, (u . v) = 0
    * [4.17.3: Example 3]
    * Example 4 ( T or F )
      * The zero vector in R^n is orthogonal to every vector in R^n
        * T
### orthogonal complements
  * a vector v is in Wperp if and only if v is orthogonal to every vector in a basis of W
    * only have to check vs the first 2 in a basis
  * note that Wperp is a subspace of R<sup>n</sup>
  * Example 5
    * Wperp is L, Lperp is W
  * The orthogonal complement of the row space of A is the null space of A, and the orthogonal complement of the oclumn space of A is the null space of A<sup>T</sup>
