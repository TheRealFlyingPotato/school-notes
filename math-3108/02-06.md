* Example 3 (2.5.1)
### We're doing the same thing again!
* old: solve Ax = b
* new: is b in the range of the linear transformation x -> Ax?

* Example 4 (2.5.2)
* Example 5 (2.5.3)
  * same vectors as 2.5.2
  * A is different
* Example 6 (2.5.4)
* any linear transformation to R2 to R2 can be a matrix transformation
