Michael Ward's Review of Andrea Smith's report
---------------------------------------------

1. Well done! I really like your project, especially how everything is laid out and nicely shown. Plenty of graphs and tables. :)

2. I would recommend putting in some sort of abstract or introduction instead of just throwing the reader into the report.
