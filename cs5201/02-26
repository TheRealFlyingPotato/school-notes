#### Math ####
A vector space is a set V of vectors along with a set of scalars (let this set be the real numbers, R) // real nums
with two operations, ⨁ and ⊙, adhering to
  1. V is closed under vector addition, ⨁
     => r,u E V >= v ⨁ u E V and
     i. v ⨁ u = u ⨁ v //communative
     ii. (v ⨁ u) ⨁ w = v ⨁ (u ⨁ w) //associative
     iii. there exists a unique theta in V such that for all v in V, v ⨁ theta = theta + v = v
                  theta is the 0 element of v // 0 element
     iiii. For all v in V there exists a unique beta in V such that v ⨁ beta is the theta (zero element)
                  beta is written -v // v has a negative element
 2. V is closed under scalar multiplication, ⊙,  => Vc E R => c ⊙ v E V, 
    i.   a ⊙ (v ⊙ u) = a⊙v ⨁ a⊙u
    ii.  a⊙(b⊙v) = (ab)⊙v
    iii. (a + b)⊙v = a⊙v ⨁ b⊙v
    iv.  1 ⊙ v = v

ex: vector spaces
1. let V be the set of all ordered n-tuples (of real nums) and take ⨁ to the the "usual" sum and ⊙ to be the "dot" product
  then V is or is not a vector space. 
          ? ? ? ? ? ?
          verbalize closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication
          yes

2. V is the set of all n x m real matrices
    ⨁ is the "usual" sum and ⊙ is the "usual" product
    
#####
if V is a vector space a W is a subset of V (w <= v) and W is a vector space using the same operations as V, then W is a *subspace*
of V.
it turns out, to show a subset is a vector space, you only need to show closure.
a linear combination of vectors in a set is

Defn:
  Let S = {a1, a2, a3, ... , an} { V. if every v E V can be written as a linear combination of vectors in S, 
  then S is said to *span* V.
Defn:
  A set S {a, ... an} is said to be linearly dependent if there exists ai, 1 <= i <= n, such that a1x1 + a2x2 + anxn = 0
  for ai not all zero.
  If for a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn = v the only sol is a1 = a2 = .. an = 0
  then S is linearly independent.
  
  // if you can build any element of S out of any combination of any of the other alphas then it is linearly dependent.
  
  Defn: if a set S = {a1, ... , an} spans a vector space V
        and is linearly *independent*, S is called a basis of V. (also known as a minimal spanning set)
        // block, light, window, door > can construct any room
   ex
    R3:
        Basis S = {i, j, k}
              i = <1,0,0>
              j = <0,1,0>
              k = <0,0,1>
  infinitely many basis
          2i, j, k
          22i, j, k
          11i, j, k
          
The number of vectors in a basis, n, is called the dimension of V.
a basis is the basic building blocks in your space

#### Inner Product Spaces
Defn: an inner product space on V is a real valued function over V with
      1. (alpha, alpha) > 0,  alpha /= - vector in V
      2. (alpha, beta) = (beta, alpha)
      3. (alpha + beta, gamma) = (alpha, gamma) + (beta, gamma)
      4. (c alpha, beta) = c (calpha, beta) >> c being a real number
