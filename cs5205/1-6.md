# algorithms
* least slack time first (LST)
  * slack time: remaining time between the finish of the job and the deadline
  * "can be delayed by the slack time and still be able to finish"
  * "anytime a job is not executing its slackline is decreasing"
    * when a slack time gets to 0 it must be executed or we'll miss the deadline
 
* do not allow moving jobs between CPU
