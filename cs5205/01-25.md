Intro to RTS
Read chapter 3

* Motivation
  * flight delay due to overload during initialization
  * faster hardware? Doesn't eliminate the cause.
    * limit on how much it can speed up (law)
* Real-time processing
  * Correctness of the system
    * Logical - functional correctness
    * Temporal - response completed before deadline
  * Traditional approach - static scheduling
  * Modern approaches...
* RT Applications: Controllers
  * Sensor -> Computation -> Actuator (Input -> Compute -> Do something)
  * The more composite the hierarchy the more complex the interdependence of logic and timing
* RT Applications: Database
* RT Applications Types
  * Purely Cyclical
  * Mostly Cyclical
  * Asynchronous and Predictable
  * Asynchronous and Unpredictable
* Fast Computing vs RT Systems

Fast Computing | RT Systems 
--- | ---
Minimizing avg response time | Guarantee individual timing reqs of each task
Avg speed | Predictability of time delay
Increase response rate (num of web requests, fast movie encoding) | Guarnatee completion of critical tasks (smooth movie playing)
Limited lifetime (time-to-retire, time-to-fault) | Long lifetime (Mars rover, Voyagers, nuclear plant)

Hard RT | Soft RT | Firm RT
 :---: | :---: | :---: 
response guaanteed within the deadlines | deadlines are important for almost all cases, but sporadic longer latency does not invalidate correctness | similar to soft RT but response has no value after the deadline
-- | -- | displaying current MPH, response time for search engines
