edf rules:
  * u <= 1 (totalization of all the tasks is <= 1)
    * pi <= Di
  * delta <= 1 (Pi > Di)
    * when the deadline is less than the period
  * Maybe if U <= 1 but
    delta > 1
    * have to verify if the task is scheduleable enough
    
### example 1
* T1 (4,2,2)
* T2 (8,2,3)
*     r,e,d
* u1 = 2/4 = 1/2
* u2 = 2/8 = 1/4
* S<sub>1</sub> = 2/2 = 1
* S<sub>2</sub> = 2/3
<br>remainder of example
### Clock Driven Scheduler
* offline
  * everything was scheduled, execute what was defined before the problem was started
    * pros
      * don't have to check first, it's been predefined and verified
      * very low overhead
    * cons
      * no adabtability / flexibility
* pic 2.19.1
  * f = 4 is not ok, so
  * aim for greater frame rate?
