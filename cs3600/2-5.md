### Basic crpyto-math
* Modular arithmetic
  * clock for example
  * Congruence relation (a is congruent with b if a mod n = b mod n)
  * n is the mod of the congruence relation
  * may be rewriteeen a=kn+b
  * a congruence b (mon n) asserts that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n.
  * example
* modular multiplicative inverse
  * the number you have to multiply to get back
  * ax mod m = 1 (x is the number)
  * ax/m = 1
### multiplicative cypher
* multiply the index of the plaintext letter by the key
* i * key mod set size
* can't just use any number as key or it becomes lossy
* "relatively prime" - can't share factors
