* Compartmentalizatoin, Layering, and Isolation "big three"
* Encapsulation "private mmebers"
* Isolation: running in VM or sandbox
* Economy of mechanism: KISS
* Least privilege: Don't give people permissions they don't need
* Least Common Mechanism: Each user has their own mechanism, config, software, etc
* Psychological Acceptability: user-friendly
* Least astonishment: Intuitive designs
