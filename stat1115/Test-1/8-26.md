### Classical Music Experiment

* Sometimes need a control group
  * Status Quo
  * Sometimes means lack of a treatment
  * Often means the standard treatment

* Q1: what are the experimentees?
  * High school students
* Q2: What is the response?
  * Percent of correct answers
* Q3: What are the factors:
  * Music Type
* Q3: Levels of the factors:
  * MT: Classical, hard rock, none
* Q5: All possible treatments:
  * only one factor: treatments and levels are the same

### Friday 13th traffic flow (real)
* Five questions
  * Individuals:
    * Drivers
  * Response:
    * Num of cars
  * Factor(s):
    * Day
  * Levels:
    * 6th/13th
  * Treatments:
    * 1 factor -> Treatments + levels are the same thing
 
### Study of welfare for working moms ( job training program )
* Experiment or Observational study?
  * Obs. study, because the women decided for themselves whether to participate
* Response Variable:
  * income 5 years later
* factor:
  * Training program
* levels:
  * trained/didn't train
* List all treatments:
  * 1 factor, treatments -> levels are the same
* Does this study show the job program caused the observed increase in income?
  * not neccessarily
    * correlation =/= causation
    * confounding variables (e.g. motivation, can't seperate motivation from the training)
    
### Randomized Comparattive Experiment
* Control
  * control the effects of lurking variables
* Randomize
  * use chance to assign subjects to treatments
* Replicate
  * use enough subjects in each group to reduce chance variation in the results
----
### Statistically Significant
* in the end you're trying to do an experiment that matters, is what I observe between them enough of a difference to make a conclusion from the results

----
### Comparative Experiments for two treatments
* Comparative Studies
  * Goal: Compare response variable values for different treatments
    * Can be done for many treatments, but this will focus on 2
  * E.g.
    * Tylenol vs Advil, Tylenol vs Placebo, Coke vs Pepsi, weekend sales vs weekday sales, etc.
### Methods
* Paired Data Design (or matched pairs design)
  * Key is there is a link between pairs of the data
    * same person, parts produced, some kind of connection
  * * Example 1
      * done purposefully to make day not be a lurking variable
  * * Example 2: drug test
      * go a certain amount of time taking the drugs, and then don't
        * problem is that time is a lurking variable
      * pair up patients in a way so they match on all the important variables to your study (for example, gender, weight, eating habits)
        * huge assumption that I have paired with someone like you
* Two independent random sample
  * data is not paired, no link
    * Example 1: doesn't matter the day
