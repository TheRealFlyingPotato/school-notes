* Statistics: the science of data
* Individual: an object described by a set of data
* Variable: a characteristic of the individual
----
Planning a study
  * what? precise definitions of the variables, units of measurement
  * where? context of data collection (population vs sample)
  * when? ^
  * why? what is the purpose of the study
----
* Categorical / Qualatative variable: places individuals into one of several groups or categories
  * a,b,c
* Quantitative variable: takes numerical values for which arithmetic operations make sense 
  * averaging, etc

### Variable Types
* Nominal Variable
  * Kind of Categorical Variable
  * The values "name" the attribute uniquely
* Oridnal Variable
  * Kind of categorical variable
  * When attributes can be rank-ordered

* Population vs Sample
** Statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we want info (everybody)
** Sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect info

* lowercase n is sample size

### Sample Designs
* Bad Sample Designs:
  * Convenience Sample
    * those easiest to get
  * Voluntary Response Sample / Self-Selected Sample:
    * Must be open to the entire population
    * They make the choice themselves whether they will respond or not (e.g. internet polls, not calling people)
    * Caution: Majority of people that participate in those have strong opinions one way or another
* Good Sample Designs:
  * Random Sampling
    * Central principle of statistical sampling that should eliminate the bias
    * simple random sample (SRS):
      * every population member must have an equal chance to be in the sample
      * every subset of size n must have the same chance of being picked as another subset of size n for the sample
    * Stratified Random Sample:
      * step 1: break your population up into important groups called "Strata"
        * ex: female psychology, male psychology, female IST, male IST
      * step 2: Take a SRS from within each strata
      * step 3: Combine the SRS's to form your final sample
      * note: usually done when it is believed an SRS would leave out a portion
      * note: stratified random sample usually tries to match population (e.g. 25% female, get 25% female answers)
    * Cluster Sampling
      * Identify "clusters" within a population"
        * ex. Countries, nursing homes, factories
        * ex. Studying a region, tag animals, let them go, region is broke into sections, randomly select a section
      * tends to be when relating to geographic data
    * Mult-stage: 
      * cluster random can be multi-stage
      * any combinations of single-stage methods

### Inference about the population
* The purpose of a sample is to give us info about a larger population. Goal is a <b>representative sample</b>.
