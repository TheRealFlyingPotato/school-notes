scatterplots
Example for Exam 1
no outliers
2 clusters
linear
pos

Example:
x = gross family income
y = cost of house when purchased
outliers: 1 (same trend but isolation)
clusters: (1 or 2)

Regression Line:
(y= mx + b)
y^ = b0 + b1x
b1: slope
b0: intercept
y^ = predicted value of y

get the hat on there

interpretation of the intercept and slope ----
x = 0 -> expl. variable = 0
b0 = y^
b0 = -11.09
Interpret: when sales is 0, the line predicts revenue to be -11090
Extrapolation (which is baaad.. no data to actually back it up.)

determining if the regression line is doing a good job. (r2 value)
r2 -> the proportion of variation in the response, y that is explained by the line with the explanatory variable, x.
r2 * 100%
impossible to give a rule about r2 and how good a line is.
